npx create-react-app client


npm is primarily used for package management (installing, updating, and managing dependencies), while npx is used for executing commands from npm packages, especially when you don't want to install the packages globally or locally.

npm i react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit redux-persist react-dropzone dotenv formik yup react-router-dom@6 @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material


toolkit makes using redux very easy for state management
redux-persist - selectively store state locally if needed
dropzone - will handle file upload on the front-end so that we can send it to the back-end  
dotenv - for environment variables
formik - for form data
yup - for validation


npm run start -> for running the front-end.
